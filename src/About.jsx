                        I embarked on my educational journey at Benevolent Nursery and Primary School, where I spent 11 formative years building a strong academic foundation. In 2014, I transitioned to Ibadan Grammar School, where I completed my junior and senior secondary education over six years, graduating in 2020. <br />

                        After finishing secondary school, I pursued a National Diploma at The Polytechnic Ibadan from 2022 to 2024. During my time there, I gained valuable technical knowledge and hands-on experience that have been crucial in shaping my career in technology. <br /> <br />

                        My passion for programming ignited a year after completing secondary school. I started with the basics, learning HTML and CSS to understand the structure and styling of web pages. This foundational knowledge paved the way for my deeper dive into JavaScript in 2023, where I expanded my capabilities to include dynamic and interactive web development. <br /> <br />

                        In 2023, I further broadened my skill set by learning Node.js and React.js, allowing me to build full-stack applications and modern, responsive user interfaces. My continuous learning journey didn't stop there. In June 2024, I began mastering Tailwind CSS, enhancing my ability to create visually appealing and efficient designs. <b />

                        Through these experiences, I have developed a robust set of technical skills and a deep understanding of web development, positioning me well for a successful career in the tech industry.

                        I have extensive experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, and SCSS, which I've applied across various projects to build robust and scalable web applications. Here are some highlights of my work:
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        JavaScript:
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        <span>Pmsystem: </span> In this project, I utilized JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. By leveraging React.js, I developed components that enhanced the user experience and facilitated seamless data management. <br />
                        <span>Movie Box: </span> For the 'Movie Box' project, I used JavaScript to implement the frontend with React.js and the backend with Express.js. This involved building features like movie search and ticket booking, ensuring smooth interaction between the client and server. <br />
                        <span>Webpast Question: </span> This project required extensive use of JavaScript to handle user input and dynamically render past questions based on user selection. JavaScript's flexibility allowed for efficient DOM manipulation and event handling.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        SCSS:
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        <span>Worldpeal Fruit Website: </span>
                        For this e-commerce platform, I utilized SCSS to create a responsive and visually appealing design. SCSS's nesting and mixins made it easier to manage and reuse styles across different components, leading to a consistent and maintainable codebase. <br />
                        <span>Pmsystem: </span> SCSS was instrumental in styling the project management system's interface, allowing for a clean and organized layout. The use of variables and functions in SCSS helped in creating a theme that could be easily adjusted based on user preferences.
